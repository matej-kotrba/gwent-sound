# Feature: Fix Coin Animation

**ID:** 03-fix-coin-animation
**Status:** Done

## Description

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] The coin animation plays smoothly and correctly on every click of the "Toss Coin" button.
- [x] The coin visually spins and lands on the correct side (front or back) based on the toss result.
