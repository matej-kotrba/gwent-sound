When implementing from `PLAN.md`, follow these guidelines for feature tracking:

1.  **Create records for new features only.** When starting a new major phase from the plan (e.g., "Phase 3: Coin Toss Mechanism"), create a single new feature file in the `features/` directory (e.g., `features/02-coin-toss-mechanism.md`).

2.  **Update existing records for modifications.** If you are modifying, tweaking, or adding a sub-task to an existing feature, update its corresponding feature file with the new information. Do not create a new file for small changes.

3.  **Always read the feature file first.** Before beginning work, read the relevant feature file to understand its scope, status, and requirements.
