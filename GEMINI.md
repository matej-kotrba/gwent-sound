When implementing from the plan, always implement it one step at a time and then wait for approval.

When creating or updating a feature, create or update a corresponding record in the `@features/` directory. This will help keep track of all implemented features and their status.

Before starting work on a feature, always read its corresponding file in the `@features/` directory to understand its current state, requirements, and any other implications.
